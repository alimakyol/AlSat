Got this issue today on windows, but don't need to downgrade node, just as discussed on stackoverflow just need to change some hashes on your project:

\node_modules\metro-config\src\defaults\blacklist.js

var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[/\\]react[/\\]dist[/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];
change to:

var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[\/\\]react[\/\\]dist[\/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];
Hope it works like worked for me :)

It's more a crutch rather than a good solution. It will work until the metro-config is updated.
I have the same issue and I've downgraded to the node version 12.9.1. Only that really helped. Thanks to
